    <p class="lead fs-3">Boiler Books is an expense and income tracking system.</p>
    <p class="fs-5">
    It was developed on behalf of IEEE to track all purchases for the organization.
    The system allows any IEEE member to create an account and request to purchase
    something on behalf of the indicated committee. The purchase may then be approved
    or denied by the committee chair (or designated member). If the purchase is
    approved, the member will then proceed to buy the item. After it is bought the
    receipt shall be uploaded to allow for timely reimbursement by the IEEE treasurer.
    </p>
    <p class="fs-5">
    In addition to being a convenient system to request and approve purchases, members
    also have the ability to view all of their past purchases. Those with the appropriate
    permissions are also able to view purchases and income for their entire committee.
